# dungeons of ufeff

This is a rebuild of a git repository from ufeffjam 1, a private game jam which
ran for approximately a month some time around July to August 2020. The tag
v1.0 represents the source code as the game was released for the game jam,
though it won't compile without also locating the exact version of tiled and
MSVC.
